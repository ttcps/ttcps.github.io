<h3 id="left">Under the pandemic</h3>
<p id="text">Early 2020, COVID-19 outbreak. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to stay home to fight the virus, we take this opportunity, try hard to make more plugins for TheoTown Community. In this period, we produced over 20 plugins, it's amazing and unbelievable. From May, we paused our process of producing plugin, we need to take care of some stuff of our life. But at the end of July, we restarted for producing plugin. We've produced 8 plugins, only a few weeks.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="left">After restart</h3>
<p id="text">After the restart we did so many things, we create so many plugins and a whole new website. Information Department has worked for them for so many days and night. The website includes useful information, such as news about tcps. Plugins are also brilliant, one of them, China Modern Office Building was ranked as a featured plugin. It's best to be your city's landmarks. All of our plugins will upload to our website, but we still want you to download them from plugin store, it's easier and covers bigger.</p>
